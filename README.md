# The Midburn Kubernetes Environment

The Midburn Kubernetes environment manages most Midburn infrastructure as code.

You can create a new environment using Google Cloud or, if you are familiar with Kubernetes, you can deploy the helm charts to any Kubernetes cluster.

## Interacting with the environment

### Prerequisites

* Using Linux / OSX? Use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* Using Windows? Use [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/quickstart)

### Quickstart

#### Managing core midburn environments

* Start a bash shell with all required dependencies and midburn-k8s code
  * `docker run -it --entrypoint bash -e OPS_REPO_SLUG=Midburn/midburn-k8s orihoch/sk8s-ops`
* Authenticate with Google Cloud Platform
  * `gcloud auth login`
* Switch to an environment
  * `source switch_environment.sh staging`
* Use `kubectl` to interact with Kubernetes
  * `kubectl get pods`
* Use `helm` to manage releases
  * `helm ls`
  
#### Development of the infrastructure

* Clone the midburn-k8s repo
  * `git clone https://github.com/Midburn/midburn-k8s.git`
  * `cd midburn-k8s`
* Run with volume to the local midburn-k8s code
  * `docker run -it --entrypoint bash -v `pwd`:/ops orihoch/sk8s-ops`
* Continue with step above for managing the core environments, you can make changes to the files and they will be reflected inside the docker container

#### Using Minikube for local development

Minikube can only run from a local Linux environment, you might need to install some dependencies, check the error messages.

You should also have a Google Cloud service account json file with read permissions to Midburn google project

*  [Install Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases)
* Start a cluster
  * `minikube start`
* Clone the midburn-k8s repo
  * `git clone https://github.com/Midburn/midburn-k8s.git`
* Change to the midburn-k8s directory
  * `cd midburn-k8s`
* Switch to the minikube environment
  * `source switch_environment.sh minikube`
* Verify you are connected to `minikube` node
  * `kubectl get nodes`
* Install [helm client](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-the-helm-client)
* Initialize helm
  * `helm init --history-max 1 --upgrade --wait`
* Verify helm version on both client and server
  * `helm version`
* Create the pull secret to the midburn project on google compute cloud
  * `kubectl create secret docker-registry gcr-json-key --docker-server=https://gcr.io --docker-username=_json_key --docker-password="$(cat /service-account.json)" --docker-email=youremail@example.com`
* Patch the default serviceaccount to use the pull secret
  * `kubectl patch serviceaccount default -p '{"imagePullSecrets": [{"name": "gcr-json-key"}]}'`
* You should be able to install a chart, it will use the main environment staging values - which will load from google's docker repo
  * `./helm_upgrade_external_chart.sh spark --install`


## Documentation

### Environments

The main environments should be committed to this repo under `environments` directory.

Each directory under `environments` corresponds to an environment name which you can connect to:

```
source switch_environment.sh ENVIRONMENT_NAME
```

Make sure you are connected to the correct environment before running any of the following commands.

You can create a new environment by copying an existing environment directory and modifying the values.

See the [sk8s environments documentation](https://github.com/OriHoch/sk8s/blob/master/environments/README.md#environments) for more details about environments, namespaces and clusters.


### Releases and deployments

[Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) manages everything for us.

* The preferred way to deploy is by opening and merging a pull request - this prevents infrastructure deployment risks and is generally more secure.
* If you intend to do some infrastructure development, consider creating your own personal environment and testing on that.

If you still want to deploy directly, just make sure you are the only one working on a chart on an environment and/or update with the master branch to prevent infrastructure conflicts.

Make sure you have the latest helm installed on both client and server: 

```
kubectl create -f rbac-config.yaml
helm init --service-account tiller --upgrade --force-upgrade --history-max 1
```

To do a full installation of all charts (after a dry run):

```
./helm_upgrade_all.sh --install --dry-run && ./helm_upgrade_all.sh --install
```

If you are working on a specific chart you can deploy only that chart:

```
./helm_upgrade_external_chart.sh CHART_NAME
```

The root infrastructure chart is deployed by:

```
./helm_upgrade.sh
```

All the helm upgrade commands use the underlying `helm upgrade` command

All additional arguments are forwarded, some useful arguments:

* For initial installation you should add `--install`
* Depending on the changes you might need to add `--recreate-pods` or `--force`
* For debugging you can also use `--debug` and `--dry-run`

When helm upgrade command completes successfully it doesn't necesarily mean deployment is complete (although it often does) - it only updates the desired state.

Kubernetes / Helm have a desired state of the infrastructure and they will do their best to move to that state.

Check [the Helm documentation](https://docs.helm.sh/) for more details.

Additionally, you can to use `force_update.sh` to force an update on a specific deployment.

If deployment fails, you might need to forcefully reinstall tiller, you can delete the deployment and reinstall

```
kubectl delete deployment tiller-deploy --namespace kube-system
```

Also, check the kube-system configmaps, make sure there aren't too much historical releases (we limit to 2, so it shouldn't happen)

```
kubectl get configmap --namespace=kube-system
```


### Helm configuration values

The default values are at `values.yaml` - these are used in the chart template files (under `templates`, `charts`  and `charts-external` directories)

Each environment can override these values using `environments/ENVIRONMENT_NAME/values.yaml`

Finally, automation scripts write values to `environments/ENVIRONMENT_NAME/values.auto-updated.yaml` using the `update_yaml.py` script


### External Charts

Charts under `charts-external` directory are deployed in a dedicated helm release for each chart.

To deploy external charts, you should use the `./helm_upgrade_external_chart.sh` script:

```
./helm_upgrade_external_chart.sh <EXTERNAL_CHART_NAME> [HELM_UPGRADE_ARGUMENTS]..
```

This script does the following:

* creates a values files containing only the values under root attributes `global` and under the chart name.
* deploys a helm release named `(MAIN_RELEASE_NAME)-(CHART_NAME)-(ENVIRONMENT_NAME)` from the helm chart under `charts-external/CHART_NAME`


### Secrets

Secrets are stored and managed directly in kubernetes and are not managed via Helm.

To update an existing secret, delete it first `kubectl delete secret SECRET_NAME`

After updating a secret you should update the affected deployments, you can use `./force_update.sh` to do that

All secrets are optional so you can run the environment without any secretes and will use default values similar to dev environments.

Each environment may include a script to create the environment secrets under `environments/ENVIRONMENT_NAME/secrets.sh` - this file is not committed to Git.

You can use the following snippet in the secrets.sh script to check if secret exists before creating it:

```
! kubectl describe secret <SECRET_NAME> &&\
  kubectl create secret generic <SECRET_NAME> <CREATE_SECRET_PARAMS>
```


### Docker OPS

To faciliate CI/CD and other automated flows we use the [sk8s-ops](https://github.com/orihoch/sk8s-ops#sk8s-ops) docker container.

To run the docker ops container locally, you should get a Google Service Account key with relevant permissions.

Download the docker ops script

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OriHoch/sk8s/master/run_docker_ops.sh && chmod +x run_docker_ops.sh
```

Get list of pods (assuming you have the required secret key under `secret-k8s.ops.json`)

```
./run_docker_ops.sh ENVIRONMENT_NAME "kubectl get pods" "orihoch/sk8sops" Midburn/midburn-k8s master secret-k8s-ops.json
```

See the [SK8S ops documentation](https://github.com/orihoch/sk8s-ops#sk8s-ops) for more details


### Patching configuration values without Helm

This method works in the following conditions:

* You want to make changes to a main / shared environment (`production` / `staging`) - otherwise, just do a helm upgrade.
* You want to modify a specific value in a specific resource (usually a deployment)
* This value is represented in the Helm configuration values

Update the auto-updated yaml value/s

```
./helm_update_values.sh '{"spark":{"image":"orihoch/spark:testing123"}}'
```

Commit and push to GitHub master branch. It's important to commit the changes to Git **first** and only then patch the deployment - this prevents infrastrcuture conflicts.

Patch the deployment and wait for successful rollout

```
kubectl set image deployment/spark spark=orihoch/spark:testing123
kubectl rollout status deployment spark
```


### Patching configuration values from CI / automation scripts

Create a [GitHub machine user](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#machine-users).

Give this user write permissions to the k8s repo.

Set the following environment variables in the CI environment:

* `K8S_OPS_GITHUB_REPO_TOKEN` - the machine user's token
* `DEPLOYMENT_BOT_EMAIL` - you can make up any email, it will show up in the commit
* `DEPLOYMENT_BOT_NAME` - same as the email, can be any name

Run the `helm_update_values.sh` script from an authenticated OPS container connected to the relevant environment

```
./helm_update_values.sh '{"spark":{"image":"orihoch/spark:testing123"}}' "${K8S_ENVIRONMANE_NAME} environment - spark image update --no-deploy"
```

Add the `--no-deploy` argument to the commit message to prevent automatic deployment if you want to deploy manually

To patch the resource manually, you could run something like this afterwards:

```
kubectl set image deployment/spark spark=orihoch/spark:testing123
kubectl rollout status deployment spark
```


### Continuous Deployment

Each app / module is self-deploying using the above method for patching configurations

The continuous deployment flow is based on:

* Travis - runs the deployment script on each app's repo on commit to master branch (AKA merge of PR).
* Ops Docker (see above) - provides a consistent deployment environment and to securely authenticate with the service account secret.
* GitHub - for persistency of deployment environment values - GitHub maintains the state of the environment. Each app commits deployment updates to the k8s repo.

We use [Travis CLI](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#installation) below but you can also do the setup from the UI.

Enable Travis for the repo (run `travis enable` from the repo directory)

Copy `.travis.yml` from this repo to the app repo and modify the values / script according to your app requirements

Set the k8s ops service account secret on the app's travis

This command should run from the root of the external app, assuming the midburn-k8s repo is a sibling directory:

```
travis encrypt-file ../midburn-k8s/secret-midburn-k8s-ops.json secret-midburn-k8s-ops.json.enc
```

Copy the `openssl` command output by the above command and modify in the .travis-yml

The -out param should be `-out k8s-ops-secret.json`

Create a GitHub machine user according to [these instructions](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#machine-users).

Give this user write permissions to the k8s repo.

Add the GitHub machine user secret key to travis on the app's repo:

```
travis env set --private K8S_OPS_GITHUB_REPO_TOKEN "*****"
```

Commit the .travis.yml changes and the encrypted file.


### Exposing services

Main entrypoint is a [traefik](https://traefik.io/) service, exposed via a load balancer.

Traefik provides application load balancing with path/host-based rules. HTTPS is provided seamlessly using Let's encrypt.

In addition to traefik, the nginx pod can optionally be used on specific service for more advanced use-cases such as auth or caching.


### Static IP for the load balancer

Reserve a static IP:

```
gcloud compute addresses create midburn-ENVIRONMENT_NAME-traefik --region=us-central1
```

Get the static IP address:

```
gcloud compute addresses describe midburn-ENVIRONMENT_NAME-traefik --region=us-central1 | grep ^address:
```

Update in `values.ENVIRONMENT_NAME.yaml`:

```
traefik:
  loadBalancerIP: <THE_STATIC_IP>
```


### Http authentication

HTTP authentication is provided using nginx.

You should configure a traefik backend that points to the nginx pod on a specific port number, then update `nginx-conf.yaml` to handle that port number with http auth enabled.

To add a user to the htpasswd file:

```
htpasswd ./secret-nginx-htpasswd superadmin
```

(use `-c` if you are just creating the file)

set the file as a secret on k8s:

```
kubectl create secret generic nginx-htpasswd --from-file=./secret-nginx-htpasswd
```

Update the value in `values.ENVIRONMENT_NAME.yaml`:

```
nginx:
  htpasswdSecretName: nginx-htpasswd
```


### Authorize with GitHub to push changes

Having infrastructure as code means you should be able to push any changes to infrastructure configuration back to GitHub.

You can use the following procudure on both Google Cloud Shell and from local PC

Create an SSH key -

```
[ ! -f .ssh/id_rsa.pub ] && ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "${USER}@cloudshell"
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Add the key in github - https://github.com/settings/keys

Clone the repo

```
git clone git@github.com:midburn/midburn-k8s.git
```



### Delete an environment and related resources

```
helm delete midburn --purge
```


### Shared / Persistent Storage

Shared / Persistent storage is available by a dedicated storage instance which pods can connect to using NFS.

Following method can be used to migrate existing data or to create a new persistent storage volume

SSH to the storage node

```
gcloud compute ssh midburn-k8s-persistent-storage-vm
```

Following should run as your personal user account under the storage node:

```
mkdir -p /data/<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>/<STORAGE_NAME>
```

At this point you can optionally migrate data from an existing pod (you will need to connect to the environment from the storage node)

```
gcloud auth login
git clone https://github.com/Midburn/midburn-k8s.git ~/midburn-k8s
cd ~/midburn-k8s
source switch_environment.sh <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
kubectl cp <POD_NAME>:/path/to/data /data/<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>/<STORAGE_NAME>
```

Make sure data directory has correct permissions

```
sudo chown -R root:root /data/<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>/<STORAGE_NAME>
```

Use the volume in a pod

```
      {{ if .Values.global.persistentStorageIP }}
        volumeMounts:
        - name: <STORAGE_NAME>
          mountPath: /path/to/data
      volumes:
      - name: <STORAGE_NAME>
        nfs:
          path: "/data/{{ .Values.global.environmentName }}/<STORAGE_NAME>"
          server: {{ .Values.global.persistentStorageIP | quote }}
      {{ end }}
```
